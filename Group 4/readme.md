## Abstract
We intended to have a sperm cell head morphology multiclassifier. Here, we take advantage of 2 publicly available datasets (the SCIAN and HuSHeM datasets) to tackle the laborious problem of classification of sperm cell heads. We explore diverse convolutional neural network architectures in an attempt to find the most promising architecture for this particular classification task. Our results confirm the high degree of inter-expert variability in the laborious task of classification of sperm head analysis. Our achieved overall accuracy of 39% on unseen data and low precision and recall scores for the different classes showcases the scarcity and poor resolution of publicly available data for the present problem.

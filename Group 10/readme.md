## Abstract
This work implements a Deep Learning model that is capable of classifying digital images of traffic signs. Traffic sign classification is used for example in cars to automatically provide information about the currently applicable traffic rules like the speed limit to the driver or an automated driving system.
The images used to train and test the model were obtained from ‘Institute Für Neuroinformatik’ which has ‘The German Traffic Sign Benchmark’ [1]. The type of Deep Learning model that was selected for this task is a convolutional neural network (CNN).

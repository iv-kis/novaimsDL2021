## Abstract
We wanted to train a classifer that can detect whether a patient has Covid or not. The
classifer should not only detect Covid from healthy person but also differentiate Covid
from other respiratory infection because it needs different treatment and isolation. The
classifer receives an chest scan image with at least 150 x 150 pixels and outputs either
positive or negative. Our aim was to create a Convolutional Neural Network that would be able to
detect the cloud-like structures in the lung with the goal to optimize
both precision and recall.

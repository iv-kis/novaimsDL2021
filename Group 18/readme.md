## Abstract
Our team has been asked to explore the
implementation of various Deep Learning
concepts within the context of some problem.
We have defined a multiclass image
classification problem for exploration. Our
proposal is to develop a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) with tuned hyperparameters to
obtain the best performance on our image
dataset. We will simultaneously develop a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to
develop synthetic images which will also be fed
to our network. Our objective is to see if data
augmentation by means of a GAN can help to
improve the performance of our CNN.
The proposed system will have real and
synthetic images as input and output the image
class. This structure is simulating the
experience of not having sufficient data to train
a good model and requiring the generation of
artificial images that accurately mimic the
image classes.
